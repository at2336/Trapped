The game is a top-down puzzle with differing puzzles for each level. The goal is to reach the portal(upper-right hand corner) 
in order to reach the next stage without touching the enemies. Upon touching an enemy, the player will die, losing the game.

The first level doesn't have any enemies. The player must slide on the ice using the boxes and walls to reach the portal. 
When a player moves, the character is unable to change directions or stop until the character collides with something. 
The player must then use this and brainstorm a strategy to reach the end. The controls are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys.

The second stage is similar, but the character is not limited to sliding in one direction at any given moment. 
The user has free movement, and must reach the end without before getting hit by the enemies. 
The boxes teleport a user randomly when the user is within a certain area. 

For the third stage, the player must push the box onto the tiles in order for the player to win while avoiding the enemies. 
Upon reaching the portal, the player will be shown a winning message and the game will end. 
On the other hand, if the player loses/dies, he will be shown a game over. Pressing spacebar will also result in a game over anytime during the game.

I designed the game using a tile map with spritesheets and translating the view matrix so window focuses on the map. 
The player, enemies, boxes, and portal are all entities in the entities vector. There is a flag that checks if an entity is static or not. 
Using this flag, I can control whether the user is sliding so he cannot change directions or stop until colliding. 
Movement is determined by using lerp on the velocity with a fixed timestep for better collision detection and movement.
